# Airline-Ticket-Prediction-Analysis
This project focuses on predicting airline ticket prices using a Linear Regression model implemented in Python.

## Description
The goal of this project is to perform an **Airline ticket prediction analysis** by building a predictive model using Python. The model applies **Linear Regression** to estimate ticket prices based on key factors like time, airline, route, etc.

---

## Features
- Analyze and predict airline ticket prices.
- Utilizes a Linear Regression model for predictions.
- Built with Python and relevant data science libraries.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arshiya109/Airline-Ticket-Prediction-Analysis.git

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python ticket_prediction.py

## Results

The model predicts airline ticket prices based on various input features and provides insights into key factors influencing ticket costs. Results include:

Prediction accuracy score (RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error).
Graphical insights showing trends in ticket pricing.
